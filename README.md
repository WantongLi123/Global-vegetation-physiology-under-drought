# Global-vegetation-physiology-under-drought

This repository contains two parts for a paper to be published as: Li, W., Pacheco-Labrador, J., Migliavacca, M., Miralles, D., Hoek van Dijke, A., Reichstein, M., Forkel, M., Zhang, W., Frankenberg, C., Panwar, A., Zhang, Q., Weber, U., Gentine, P., Orth, R. (2023). Widespread and complex drought effects on vegetation physiology inferred from space (Under review).

i) Demo codes to calculate vegetation physiological components;

ii) Codes required to reproduce main figures in the paper.

Note:

(i) The raw data formatted as .npy required to calculate vegetation physiological components are stored at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7971170

(ii) The raw datasets used to compute all analysis results are shared with public links in the paper. Processed data required to produce the final figures are also stored at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7971170

(iii) Conda environment installation:

Please use the enivronment.yml to set up the environment for runing provided codes. The Linux command for environment installation: conda env create -f enivronment.yml
